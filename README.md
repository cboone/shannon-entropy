# A Mathematical Theory of Communication

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of [SamuelSchlesinger/shannon-1948-formalization](https://github.com/SamuelSchlesinger/shannon-1948-formalization), in which I'm expanding the formalization to cover the entirety of [Shannon's paper](./references/shannon1948.pdf).

This repository formalizes Shannon's finite-alphabet characterization theorem
from Shannon (1948), Appendix 2.

The central result is:

- For any uncertainty functional `H` satisfying the Shannon-style axiom bundle
  (continuity, strict monotonicity on uniform distributions, grouping, and
  relabel invariance), there is a positive constant `K` such that
  `H(p) = -K * Σ p_i log p_i`.
- Equivalently, for any base `b > 1`, there is `Kb > 0` such that
  `H(p) = -Kb * Σ p_i log_b p_i`.

## Formalization Scope

- Finite alphabets only.
- Real-valued probability vectors with explicit simplex proofs.
- Proof structure follows Shannon's Appendix-2 phases:
  1. Equiprobable case (`A(n)` behaves logarithmically).
  2. Rational probabilities via grouped equiprobable refinement.
  3. Extension to real probabilities via continuity and rational approximation.

## How To Read The Proof

If you want to read this like a paper:

1. Start in `Shannon/Entropy/Core.lean` for definitions and axioms.
2. Read `Shannon/Entropy/Uniform.lean` for the equiprobable logarithm law
   (`Apos H n = K * log n`).
3. Read `Shannon/Entropy/Rational.lean` for rational distributions via grouping.
4. Read `Shannon/Entropy/Approx.lean` for the continuity bridge
   (`approxProb p N → p`).
5. Finish in `Shannon/Entropy/Final.lean` for the final uniqueness theorems.
6. Continue to `Shannon/Entropy/Gibbs.lean` for the Gibbs inequality.
7. Read `Shannon/Entropy/Joint.lean` for joint distributions and the chain rule.
8. Read `Shannon/Entropy/Properties.lean` for the Section 6 entropy properties.
9. Read `Shannon/Entropy/Converse.lean` for the proof that `entropyNat` satisfies the axioms.

For pedagogical context, see the worked decomposition theorem in
`Shannon/Entropy/Rational.lean`:

- `worked_grouping_identity`
- `workedCompose_masses`

## Build and Verify

Requirements:

- Lean toolchain from `lean-toolchain`
- Lake (bundled with Lean)

Commands:

```bash
lake build
```

CI workflow:

- `.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml` (`Lean Action CI`)

## Notes on Axioms

Shannon's symmetry principle ("depends only on probabilities, not labels") is
represented explicitly as:

- `ShannonEntropyAxioms.relabelInvariant`

This makes permutation/relabeling steps fully explicit in Lean proofs.

## AI Assistance

This project was developed with substantial assistance from Claude (Anthropic).
Claude contributed to proof development, code structure, and documentation
throughout the formalization effort.
